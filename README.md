## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup

After you have launched the software, follow these steps:

1. **Allow any security warnings or permission requests.** Windows may show a message alerting you that this app could affect your device. This is normal due to the nature of the cheat.

3. **Launch Valorant:** Start Valorant as you normally would.

4. **Attach the Cheat:** Return to the cheat application and use the option labeled “Attach” or “Start.” This connects the cheat to the running game.

5. **Configure Options:** The cheat interface should provide toggle switches or buttons for different cheat functions, such as aim assist or wallhack. Enable or disable features as you prefer.

6. **Play the Game:** Once set, switch to Valorant and enjoy your game with the enabled features.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Tips

- **Windows Defender or Antivirus blocks the cheat:** Temporarily disable security software or add the cheat folder to exceptions. EFI drivers trigger alerts since they interact deeply with Windows.

- **The cheat won’t attach to Valorant:**  
  - Ensure Valorant is running with administrator rights.  
  - Restart both Valorant and the cheat program.  
  - Reinstall the EFI drivers when prompted.

- **Error messages about missing files:** Re-download the release package and extract again. Make sure your antivirus is not deleting files automatically.

- **Game crashes or stutters:**  
  - Close other programs running in the background.  
  - Reduce cheat features enabled to minimize performance impact.
